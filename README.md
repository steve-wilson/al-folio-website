If you are looking for my live website, please go to https://steverw.com

The source for that page ~~is~~ was once stored here. It was based on the awesome [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio) theme. However, I eventually (and begrudgingly) switched to something even more basic (Google Sites) to minimize time spent on website updates.

Before doing that, some changes I made from the base theme included:
- Custom color scheme for day & night mode
- Format news items with fa-icons on the left
- Favicon loaded from file instead of emoji (created with https://favicon.io/)
- Office info is at bottom of page instead of under picture
- CV page with PDF rendered in page so menu bar remains available
All of those are reflected in this repo.
