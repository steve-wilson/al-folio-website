If you are looking for the live website, please go to https://steverw.com

The source for that page is stored here. It is based on the awesome [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio) theme.

Some changes I made from the base theme:
- Custom color scheme for day & night mode
- Format news items with fa-icons on the left
- Favicon loaded from file instead of emoji (created with https://favicon.io/)
- Office info is at bottom of page instead of under picture
- CV page with PDF rendered in page so menu bar remains available
