I study online communication using Natural Language Processing methods with a focus on understanding and incorporating the social context of text data and the people that create it.
<!--I've used computational methods to study how language use is related to things like personal values, everyday activities, optimism, mental health, cultural background, and city size.
The informal nature of many online social interactions also requires NLP systems to deal with a variety of interesting linguistic phenomena, and so I have also worked on approaches to model things like sarcasm, humor, offensive language, references to people, and emojis.
I'm also highly interested in the ethical implications and societal impact of AI/NLP technology and AI/NLP education. -->

                    I completed my PhD at the <a href="https://umich.edu" target="_blank">University of Michigan</a> where I was a member of the <a href="http://lit.eecs.umich.edu/" target="_blank">LIT Lab</a>. :part_alternation_mark: Go Blue!
                    After that, I spent a couple of years working as a postdoc in the <a href="http://smash.inf.ed.ac.uk/" target="_blank">SMASH</a> group at the <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/" target="_blank">University of Edinburgh</a> before moving to OU.
